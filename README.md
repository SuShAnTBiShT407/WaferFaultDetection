Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif) 
Project - Wafer Fault Detection
=============================================================================================================================================

Machine Learning Project
------------------------
This project is completed with the help of ineuron team.

Business Idea: We use wafer to create electric integration circuits. We use them in large scale so it is very hectic to check each and every wafer sensor manually so we build a ML model which reduce cost and is time efficient. We will recieve all information in byte code then we convert it to message using MQTT protocol.


Here we have also verified that either the data we received from client is according to DSA(Data Sharing Agreement).
